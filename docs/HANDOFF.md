# Latest change: mandatory SemVer and merged-PR releases

The user required public visibility, master as the default branch, a version.props bump in every PR, developer-selected major/minor/patch, and automatic published releases after merge. Branch protection requires up-to-date Semantic version and Build, test and package checks, including for admins. See VERSIONING.md. This feature raises 0.1.0 to 0.2.0. All 31 local versioning tests passed; this PR runs the full Windows/installer suite. Release publication is tested by merging this implementation PR. Follow the live Actions and Releases pages for its final result. This policy supersedes all historical private/draft/tag-only notes below.

# SoundAnchor — continuation handoff

## Canonical locations

- Local repository: **C:\devl\repositories\sound-anchor** (the user's explicitly requested location).
- Public remote: **https://github.com/rm968211/sound-anchor**.
- Full approved scope: [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). Agent entry point: [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).
- Tested implementation commit: **87cfc4b** (plus this documentation-only follow-up).
- Successful CI: https://github.com/rm968211/sound-anchor/actions/runs/35622237568

The repository was moved in full from the generated Codex workspace. Do not recreate it there.
The user approved implementation, private repo creation, full test automation, installers/uninstall,
and Actions build artifacts. They requested frequent updates and durable context for future agents.

## Delivered

- Windows 11 x64 .NET 10 WPF settings/tray app with four device preferences covering all six roles.
- Event-driven correction, verification, bounded retries, health reconciliation, pause/resume,
  missing-device preservation, saved settings, startup option, single instance and resume handling.
- Native Core Audio enumeration/notifications and isolated undocumented IPolicyConfig setter.
- Simulated-audio demo/test mode, read-only native diagnostics, opt-in native hardware probe.
- Self-contained portable ZIP and per-user Inno installer with upgrade/uninstall and startup cleanup.
- Pinned GitHub Actions workflow, monthly Dependabot, installer lifecycle automation, draft-release
  creation configured for version tags. No version tag/release has been published yet.

## Verified on 2026-09-21

- Clean Release build, zero warnings/errors after relocation.
- **22 unit/integration tests passed**, no skipped tests. Policy and settings classes reached 100%
  line coverage; total Core line coverage was 75% (includes the demo backend and presentation summary).
- **1 FlaUI desktop scenario passed**: selects all four preferences, applies, pauses, simulates a
  switch, resumes, closes to tray, reopens, exits and verifies persistence after relaunch.
- Native enumeration succeeded with 85 endpoints and 6 defaults on the development machine.
- Native setter reassertion succeeded for **6/6 roles** without selecting a different device.
- Installer install, startup registration, launch, same-version upgrade, preference preservation,
  uninstall and startup cleanup passed locally and on GitHub's Windows runner.
- CI built and uploaded installer, portable ZIP, checksums, TRX reports and coverage.

The first CI run exposed a test-cleanup race that ran the uninstaller twice. Fixed in 87cfc4b;
the subsequent complete pipeline passed. Native testing also identified stale device properties;
enumeration now falls back to endpoint IDs when friendly names are unreadable. A startup UI fix
preserves saved selections when device enumeration is initially unavailable.

## Build outputs

Successful CI packages are downloaded to `artifacts/verified-packages` and SHA-256 verified.
Copies are provided in the original task's `outputs` directory for clickable delivery:
`C:\Users\rm968\Documents\Codex\2026-09-21\referenced-chatgpt-conversation-this-is-an\outputs`.
Repository source remains exclusively at the canonical C:\devl location.

`artifacts/packages` contains the earlier local build; prefer the verified CI packages because they
include the final startup UI fix. Generated artifacts and local toolchains are ignored by Git.

## Remaining acceptance work / limits

- Actual new USB/HDMI/Bluetooth connection tests, suspend/resume, audio-service/Explorer restart,
  scaling checks, and an actual cross-version upgrade need physical/manual validation.
- The opt-in hardware probe's real-switching mode is implemented but was not run. Only native
  enumeration and reassertion of already-selected defaults were run.
- Draft-release tag execution and code signing have not been exercised. Initial binaries are unsigned.
- Default restoration reacts after Windows changes devices; a brief interruption remains possible.
- Per-app routing, volume/mute/format controls, ARM64 and auto-updates are outside the first release.
- Installer preference-removal prompt is implemented; silent uninstall preservation is automated.

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for commands and the full physical acceptance checklist. Do not report
simulations or native reassertion as proof of physical hot-plug switching.

## Local toolchain

.NET SDK 10.0.401 is at:
`C:\Users\rm968\Documents\Codex\2026-09-21\referenced-chatgpt-conversation-this-is-an\work\tools\dotnet`.
Set DOTNET_ROOT and prepend it to PATH. The NuGet cache and CLI home are adjacent `nuget` and
`cli-home` directories. GitHub CLI is `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`.
Inno compiler is `.tools/inno/ISCC.exe`; scripts can bootstrap its pinned, verified release.

The repository was originally created by the sandbox account. When using the host account, use a
process-scoped Git safe.directory for C:/devl/repositories/sound-anchor if necessary; never wildcard
global trust. The generated task's sandbox does not automatically grant writes to C:\devl, so use
the authorized filesystem approval mechanism or open this repository as a Codex project.

Useful commands: `scripts/Test.ps1`, `scripts/Build-Packages.ps1 -InnoCompiler .tools/inno/ISCC.exe`.
UI tests require an interactive desktop. Installer tests refuse existing installations and require
an explicit local switch; prefer disposable CI. No real enforcing app was left running or registered
to start at sign-in by development tests.
